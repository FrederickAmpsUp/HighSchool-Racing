	- **2.3.7 Tires:**
		- Tires must be pneumatic or soft rubber.
		- Tread must be appropriate for an asphalt or sealed concrete track surface. No knobby, studded, or off-road tires are allowed.
		- Slicks, semi-slicks, and grooved tires are allowed.
		- All four tires must match in material and tread type.
		- Both front tires must be identical. Both rear tires must be identical.
		- Tire width must not exceed 200mm per tire.
		- Tire outer diameter must not exceed 420mm.
		- Tires must be in good shape, with no signs of dry rot, sidewall damage, or exposed cords.
		- Karts with illegal tire setups may be disqualified.
- **2.4 Driver Attire:**  
	- Drivers must wear a full-face helmet, grip-enhanced gloves, closed-toe shoes, long pants, and long-sleeve shirts during all on-track activities.
	- Gloves must be nonflammable, SFI-rated (or equivalent) gloves are recommended.
	- An SFI-rated (or equivalent) fire-resistant racing suit is *strongly* recommended.
- **2.5 Fuel and Fire Safety:**
	- **2.5.1 Fuel Type:** Only gasoline or E10 fuel is permitted. No additives or alcohol blends are permitted. Track marshals may collect fuel samples for testing.
	- **2.5.2 Fuel Tank:**
		- Must be securely mounted to the chassis with mechanical fasteners.
		- Must not be located above or directly behind the driver.
		- Tanks located directly in front of the driver (e.g. behind the steering column) are allowed if securely mounted, shielded from impact, and do not obstruct driver controls.
		- Must be vented away from the driver compartment.
		- Must be made of fuel-rated plastic or metal.
	- **2.5.3 Fuel Lines:**
		- Must be securely fastened at least every 300mm along the length of the line.
		- Must be fuel-rated hose with no visible wear, cracks, or leaks.
		- No exposed fuel lines are allowed inside the driver compartment, near driver entry/exit paths, or around the kart's kill switch.
	- **2.5.4 Fill Cap:**
		- Must not leak when tipped or shaken.
		- Must seal tightly and not loosen under vibration or blunt force.
		- Must not be placed in an area prone to collision, rubbing, or excessive heat.

## 3. Racing stuff idk

## 4. Race formats
- HSR races take one of 3 different forms, as described below.
- **4.1 Endurance:**
	- **4.1.1 Structure:**
		- Three or more teams compete in a winner-takes-all endurance race.
		- The event begins with a 30 minute practice session, followed by a break and final inspections. Teams may bring their karts on and off the track to perform driver swaps and adjustments as desired.
		- The main event is a 60-minute race divided into four stints.
		- Each stint is separated by a mandatory pit stop.
	- **4.1.2 Pit Stops:**
		- Karts must enter the pit lane exactly once during each of the following times:
			- Pit 1: 13-17m after race start
			- Pit 2: 28-32m after race start
			- Pit 3: 43-47m after race start
		- Karts must remain in the pit lane for a minimum of 2 minutes during a stop.
		- Teams must complete a driver swap during each pit stop.
		- Refueling during each pit stop is encouraged but not mandatory.
		- Karts that do not adhere to pit stop regulations may incur penalties up to and including disqualification.
	- **4.1.3 Extra Regulations:**
		- All drivers must adhere to attire regulations while in the kart.
		- Drivers' attire may be shared between drivers.
		- Teams must use between two and four (inclusive) drivers during the race.
		- Karts that run out of fuel on track will not finish the race.
	- **4.1.4 Grid Position:** Starting grid positions for endurance races will be randomly chosen prior to the race start.

# all this TODO \\/
## 3. Race Format
- Initial events will focus on casual and educational racing with an emphasis on participation rather than competition; formal penalties will not be enforced.  
- Maximum race grid size will gradually increase to 8 karts as the league grows.  
- Flag signals used include: Green (go), Yellow (caution), Red (stop), Checkered (race end), and Black (reserved for future use).

## 4. Build Documentation
- Teams must submit comprehensive documentation detailing the design and fabrication of the kart’s frame, engine modifications, and safety features.  
- Emphasis is placed on student involvement in all aspects of design and construction to maximize educational value.

## 5. Budget and Parts
- Total budget for each kart is capped at $1,500 to ensure accessibility and fairness.  
- Teams may use both new and used parts, but all components must be fully documented in build submissions.  
- Students are responsible for the full assembly of their karts.

## 6. Conduct and Sportsmanship
- Participants must adhere to high standards of sportsmanship and respect for competitors, officials, and event staff.  
- Intentional collisions or dangerous driving behaviors are strictly prohibited.
